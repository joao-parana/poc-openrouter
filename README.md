# PoC OpenRouter

> LLM Proof of Concept using [deepseek-r1-0528:free model](https://openrouter.ai/deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528:free) from **openrouter.ai**

You can use this language model to test your application providing **LLM Agent** functionality without spending a single cent.

Create an account at [https://openrouter.ai/](https://openrouter.ai/) and add US $10 in credit and you will be able to use any available model. Many of them **have costs** that are debited from your account, however **you can use several free models** including the **"deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528:free"** model which has great performance with a high latency, but is sufficient for application testing.

The alternative would be to have a reasonable amount of money to use models from OpenAI or Google in your tests, which is sometimes not possible due to budget issues in the project.
